Main differences between C++ and Java
- C++ gives you access to the instance of an object, in java everything is a reference
- C++ allows for multiple inheretence which can lead to some ambiguity when a class extends from two classes which both share a common ancestor, 
	- java allows a weaker version of multiple inheretence in the form of interfaces
- C++ is compiled to native machine code, java is compiled down to an intermediary byte code which runs on java virtual machines
	- This "usually makes C++ faster" but I have recently been working on a high performance java base vision library and as long as your careful java can be as fast as C equivilant programs
- C++ forces the programmer to deal with memory directly, memory is allocated with new (or malloc from C) and must be directly deallocated 
	- java implements various garbage collection strategies, the most recent one being G1
- Friend classes or methods have access to private variables
